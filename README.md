🌤️ NurzWeather — A Weather App Born From Chaos, Built With Purpose

“This project came to life at a time when everything else was collapsing…”

NurzWeather began as a small idea — a distraction during a difficult moment — but it grew into a transformative journey of learning, resilience, and self-discovery.

What started as a simple weather app became a cinematic, animated, immersive experience blending:

Design

Storytelling

3D art

Engineering

Emotion

⭐️ Features
🌐 Installable Progressive Web App (PWA)

NurzWeather is a fully installable PWA:

✔️ Add to home screen on mobile & desktop

✔️ Works offline after first load

✔️ Custom icons, manifest & splash screens

✔️ Service worker caching

✔️ Fast & lightweight

✔️ Native app-like experience

Clean, maintainable architecture


🎯 Mission

I’ve always been fascinated by the immersive interfaces found in games and animated worlds — experiences that feel alive.

So I set out to create:

A weather app that doesn’t just show information —
but tells a story.

I wanted NurzWeather to solve a real problem and evoke emotion.
Something magical enough that a user might forget they're looking at a weather report.


✨ How It Started

For years I explored different fields:

C++

Python

Blender

Digital art

Design

But I couldn’t decide where I fit, is it Engineering? Design? Art?

Then one idea clicked:

Why not blend everything together?

I began with paper sketches → moved to Figma → then built it in React + Tailwind.


🌳 The 3D Era Begins

I discovered Spline and started modeling:

Perfume bottle

Robot

Realistic apple tree

Leaf with custom materials

Importing them into React became a boss fight:

the GLTF broke, Materials failed, Textures refused to load...

![Broken Material 3](src/assets/Portiflio/BrokenMaterial3.png)
![Broken Material 4](src/assets/Portiflio/BrokenMaterial4.png)


It felt endless — but solving this taught me how to think like an engineer.


🎬 Animation, Storytelling & System Architecture

Once the 3D scene stabilized, the magic began:

GSAP animations

Zustand global state

Cinematic intro sequence

Cloud transitions

Camera zoom

Apple fall physics

Music syncing

One tap triggers four synchronized events — something I’m truly proud of.

🌱 Lessons, Identity & Final Words

This project helped me discover who I am:

**A creative front-end developer blending design, storytelling, and engineering.

It showed me what I’m capable of:

Taking a simple thought, And turning it into a polished, immersive, living experience

_And it reminded me — and hopefully reminds you — that even during difficult times, creation can be a source of meaning —
and from collapse, something beautiful can grow._
